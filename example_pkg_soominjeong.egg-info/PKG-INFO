        [Approach]
        - Load the input data, previously stored at a known location.
        - Select, process and transform the input variables, to prepare them for training the model.
        - Perform some basic analysis of each input variable.
        - Create a machine learning model that predicts the arrival delay time.
        - Validate the created model and provide some measure of its accuracy.
        
        [Requirements]
        - All data processing, model training and validation must be done with Spark.
        - No additional machine learning libraries can be used.
        - The application must be developed in Scala, Java, Python or R.
