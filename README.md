# spark-ml-project

[Approach]
- Load the input data, previously stored at a known location.
- Select, process and transform the input variables, to prepare them for training the model.
- Perform some basic analysis of each input variable.
- Create a machine learning model that predicts the arrival delay time.
- Validate the created model and provide some measure of its accuracy.

[Requirements]
- All data processing, model training and validation must be done with Spark.
- No additional machine learning libraries can be used.
- The application must be developed in Scala, Java, Python or R.
